  aims to help researchers get their work done
  in less time and with less pain
  by teaching them basic research computing skills.
  This hands-on workshop will cover basic concepts and tools,
  including program design, version control, data management,
  and task automation.
  Participants will be encouraged to help one another
  and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.

  The goal of this lesson is to teach novice programmers to write modular code 
  and best practices for using R for data analysis. R is commonly used in many 
  scientific disciplines for statistical analysis and its array of third-party 
  packages. We find that many scientists who come to Software Carpentry workshops 
  use R and want to learn more. The emphasis of these materials is to give 
  attendees a strong foundation in the fundamentals of R, and to teach best 
  practices for scientific computing: breaking down analyses into modular 
  units, task automation, and encapsulation. Note that this workshop will 
  focus on teaching the fundamentals of the programming language R, and will not teach statistical analysis.
